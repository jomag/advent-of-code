# Advent Of Code

## 2021

Here we go ...

## 2020

I promised myself to not engage in Advent of Code this year, given
how many late, sleepless nights it caused last year. And yet here I
am, on day 2. This year I've at least decided that I will use a
language I'm really comfortable with (Python 3).

## 2019

So I decided to pick this up Advent of Code again this year.
I started on the 10:th of december and have been doing on average
about 2 puzzles (4 stars) per day.

### Day 16

Up until today I've not run into big problems, but the second
part of day 16 is tricky to solve in reasonable time. So this
was the first time I had to read up on some ideas from Reddit,
and my solution is still not quite there yet.

For this year I've decided to use Go to for all tasks. I've
never used Go before so it took some time getting up to speed.
The language is very simplistic however, which made it easy
to learn, but I also think it was a bad choice for this type
of computing task with a big focus on algorithms.

### Day 18

This day was a really tough one: at first I ran into problems getting example 4
and the puzzle input to solve in reasonable time. But most annoyingly, after
solving that, the solution for the puzzle input was too high. I spent way too long
time debugging this and seeking advice on the AoC Reddit, before I reread the
instruction for the 100th time: turns out I looked for the shortest path to visit
all keys and doors, while the task was to just visit _all keys_, not doors.

As I struggled with the exercise, I decided to retreat to Python, as I've more
experience with that language and so I can think about the problem with less
of a language overhead.

For Part 2, I consider all doors not having a key in the same quarter to
be open, solve all the four squares and use the sum of the shortest path
as answer.

The code for this day is nowhere near as clean as for most other days, and
I've still not implemented a solution in Go. I might come back to clean it
up later. Then again, maybe not...

### Day 22

First part of this day was no problem, but the second required
some math that I was simply not able to figure out. After revisiting
this day a couple of times I decided to give up on part 2
to be able to finish the whole calendar. So there's no solution
for part 2, as I used [Zedrdaves](https://github.com/zedrdave/advent_of_code/blob/master/2019/22/__main__.py)
solution. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
